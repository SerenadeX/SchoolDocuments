1. Technological Similarities
  1. This is the main point of the arguement. If there are many similarities, it gives strong evidence to the fact that Clovis descended from Solutrean. Bradley and Stanford use this arguement for the Clovis-Solutrean link. Strauss argues that notwithstanding the similiarities there are many differences between the two, or the technology is not unique to the Clovis or Solutrean peoples. The similarities consist of the spearhead that is created in a similar manner. Both Solutrean and Clovis blades are made with an overshot carving technique and both have a similar shaped and were heated to allow flaking to come easier.
2. Behavioral Similarities
  1. Bradley and Stanford mention the fact that both peoples searched for exquisite stone to be able to make their blades. Strauss states briefly that the two peoples used red ochre as well as side scrapers. They also used the same hunting techniques in using their blades as spear points.
3. Exploitation of Maritime Resources
  1. Bradley and Stanford make a huge point that the Solutrean society relied on maritime resources. Since the glaciers reached much further south back then, there were many seals that lived near the solutrean peoples. In evidence to their journey across the￼Atlantic, they speak of how they would use the glaciers as an island for temporary rest and protection from storms. 
4. Ethnographic Evidence
  1. To be honest I couldn’t see a lot solely from these two articles. Bradley and Stanford do emphasize that the Solutrean peoples must have used maritime resources. They state “How could they not use the resources in front of them?” They state that in their art the Solutrean people have drawn much that shows their reliance on maritime resources.
5. Connecting Pre-Clovis technologies
  1. There is a gap of about 5000 years that Bradley and Stanford have to fill in to connect the two peoples. They state that finding pre-clovis artifacts which date inside that gap, they discovered many similarities between them and clovis. This mainly speaks of the spear points that have similar thinned bi-faces, indented base projectile points, blades and bladettes, backed blades and overshot flaking.
6. Technological Dissimilarities
  1. Despite the many similarities between the technologies of these two peoples, there are a few differences. First of all clovis blades have whats called fluting, where they make a controlled flake from the bottom of the blade instead of from the side. The second is that Solutrean blades are generally large and there are few if any Clovis blades at the same size
7. Loss of Cultural Traits
  1. Solutreans have a lot of art. One thing that Strauss mentioned is that the Clovis have very little art that has been discovered. If art was so important to the Solutrean way of life why has it disappeared after they came to America?
8. Lack of evidence of Maritime Resources
  1. The Solutreans, although they have a lot of art of seals, do not have any evidence in the archaelogical record that shows they hunted seals. Strauss says that they may have found carcasses of seals but they never went to hunt them. There is a significant lack of seal remains in the Solutrean areas.
9. Lack of Boat/Marine Tecnology
  1. The problem with boats is that they decompose quickly. Even if the Solutreans did use boats there would be no evidence of it. The clovis people have absolutely no evidence of any use of large bodies of water. The clovis blades are found mainly inland, far from the ocean and there is no evidence of them travelling to the ocean.
10. Chronological Problems
  1. The Solutrean people date back to 20,500-17000 14 C yrs bp where the Clovis people date back to 11,500-10,900 14 C yrs bp. That leaves a gap of about 5000 years between the two peoples. What little evidence that has been found that dates in between those two times is scarce at best. Yes there is some but very little compared to the amount of Solutrean and Clovis blades.
