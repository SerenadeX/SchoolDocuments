# Angels and Service 

- Lk12/8-14 
- Mi7/29-31 

A person who is a divine messenger is an angel. 

One might ask, “Why were angels so prominent at the Saviorʼs birth? And why were they such an important part of His life and ministry?” The answers are twofold. The ﬁrst pertains to the nature and mission of the personage whom they were heralding: a divine Being, the Son of God, the Only Begotten in the ﬂesh who came to earth to save all of Godʼs children. The second concerns the ushering in of a new dispensation, a period of time when the gospel would be restored in its fulness. The ministry of angels is to assist in the ushering in of dispensations (see Moroni 7:29–31). Merril J. Bateman

From the beginning down through the dispensations, God has used angels as His emissaries in conveying love and concern for His children. Holland

What is the lesson for us today as we enter a new Christmas season? Who will minister to those in need? Who are the angels that will prepare the way for His return? I have noticed that during the early stages of a dispensation, angelic ministers come from the other side of the veil, but as time elapses and the number of faithful members increases, more is expected of those in mortality. For example, when a new country is opened to the gospel, missionaries learn that many have been prepared in miraculous ways to receive the gospel, and miracles occur with some frequency to advance the work. Once a core of members is established, however, the Lordʼs assistance changes as He provides opportunities for the members to become the miracle workers. Merril J. Bateman
